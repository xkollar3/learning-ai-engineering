# Very unserious DMS created for me to learn about RAG a little

- Project is referred to as udms
- This repo was created because I watched a lecture about RAG in python and wanted to try in Java
- There are no tests because I believed everything would work first shot so we don't need any
- Later I added APIs to play around with the services using CURL
- udms is a CLI client script fully generated by claude because I threatened him with jail time

- TBD: try some more advanced techniques like multi query, better semantic indexing for documents (split by paragraph?), query decomposition and other techniques
